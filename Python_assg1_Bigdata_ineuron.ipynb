    "Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the basic principle of coding, the factor that makes a language high level is its distance from machine binary code. Python is understood as a high-level, interpreted general-purpose language. This means it is not your straight compiled language (like Java or C) but an interpreted dynamic language that has to be run in the given system using another program instead of its local processor. When compiled, other languages turn into Assembly and run directly in the processor. Hence, being an interpreted language, which is not subject to the processor, makes Python a high-level programming language."
